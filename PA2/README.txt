LLM Prompting Process:

Ethan - 
	My invovlement in the programming assignment was creating the Makefile. With ChatGPT I gave it all the necessary files needed to create the Makefile. Afterwards I helped trying to solve an issue with the wait times not being in the correct order, and the hash values not being correct.


Anthony -
	For this programming assignment, I used Gemini AI to help me figure out how to approach the problem. Initially, my teammates had suggested that I handle the hash table operations, so I used AI to help me generate the code for this part of the assignment. Furthermore, I used it to help me generate chash, which was the main part of the assignment and the most complex one as well. I made sure that the model followed assignment guidelines, such as hardcoding “commands.txt.” Because the sample output specifications for the assignment changed, my teammates, using the chash file as a foundation, corrected it to match the final correct output. Finally, I dived into a conceptual journey where I learned a lot about the purpose of the assignment and what exactly we were testing. The use of Gemini AI was extremely helpful in solving the problem we were presented with.
