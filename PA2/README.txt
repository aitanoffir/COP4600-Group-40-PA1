LLM Prompting Process:

	My invovlement in the programming assignment was creating the Makefile. With ChatGPT I gave it all the necessary files needed to create the Makefile. Afterwards I helped trying to solve an issue with the wait times not being in the correct order, and the hash values not being correct.

	For this programming assignment, I utilized Gemini AI to assist me in determining
the best approach to the problem. Initially, my teammates had suggested that I handle
the hash table operations, so I used AI to help me generate the code for this part of
the assignment. Furthermore, I used it to help me generate chash, which was the main
part of the assignment and the most complex one as well. I made sure that the model
followed assignment guidelines, such as hardcoding “commands.txt.” Because the sample
output specifications for the assignment changed, my teammates, using the chash file
as a foundation, corrected it to match the final correct output. Finally, I dived into
a conceptual journey where I learned a lot about the purpose of the assignment and what
exactly we were testing. The use of Gemini AI was extremely helpful in solving the 
problem we were presented with. 

Andres - 
	For this project I used Claude AI to help me understand how everything was structured 
and what needed to be done. At this point we had done the synchronization aspects of the 
project and we still had the hash table and main program left. So, I decided to undergo 
completing the hash table. I gave Claude a word document that gave it all of the requirements 
of the assignment and several text files for the inputs and outputs. Then, I asked it to 
generate the hash table program with its corresponding header file. I then went over all 
of the code and verified that everything was working as expected. There was an error popping 
up in VS Code that I did not understand, but once asking Claude about it, I understood that 
I was getting this error because of a lack of some native support for these header files on 
Windows as compared to Linux. Using Claude was extremely helpful and insightful for this project.
